TODO
====
* Before we can make the ibus boiler plate running,
  we need to package the current code. Otherwise,
  my sanity will be eclipsed.

    - Write a setup.py file.

    - Oraganize the adhoc tests.

    - Write a Readme file.

* Make the ibus-boiler plate up and running.

* Write the main transliteration pipeline.
  Decisions to make:
     - Do we need character pinning?

       We invented character pinning for all those
       planned stupid features like reverse transliterations
       and raw-cursors. Other than that, character pinning
       is useless. So, No; we don't need character pinning.

     - Do we need character suggestions?

       No. We don't need character suggestion system. This
       was a messed up feature that delayed all the previous
       releases.


* Implement the special rule system.

* Implement proper history system. Please don't do all the security
  shenanigans like previous iterations.

* Implement autocorrection ( magic word transliterations ). Aren't
  autocorrections and history basically same thing?
