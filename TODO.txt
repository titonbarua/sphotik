* Write the main transliteration pipeline.
  Decisions to make:
     - Do we need character pinning?

       We invented character pinning for all those
       planned stupid features like reverse transliterations
       and raw-cursors. Other than that, character pinning
       is useless. So, No; we don't need character pinning.

     - Do we need character suggestions?

       Do people really want character suggestions? I don't know.
       If it is trivial, we should do it. Recursive multilayer
       character suggestion is a no-no.

* Add conjunction creator.
