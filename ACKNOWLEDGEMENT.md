# Acknowledgement

- Thanks to Avro project for creating such an wonderful piece of software
  and an intuitive phonetic rule-set for Bangla. I've studied sources of
  both scim-avro and ibus-avro and learned a lot from them.

- Thanks to my project manager Tutul. Without his constant push
  for release, I could never complete it! :3 ( It's already 3 years
  too late and released source code is the 3rd iteration. )

- Thanks to my colleagues at Vimmaniac, Palash and Ahsan for their
  constant mockery of my 'estimated release date'! Couldn't hope for
  a better source of inspiration! >(

- Thanks to Nafeez for testing the early iterations.

- Thanks to my friends Minhajul and Shib for rekindling my
  interest in the project after many years and alpha testing it.
